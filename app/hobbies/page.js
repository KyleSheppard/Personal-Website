      <h2>Hunting</h2>
      <p>
        Hunting has been a part of my life since I was a kid. Growing up in Grants Pass, I was surrounded by beautiful country that offers great opportunities for hunting.

        I primarily hunt deer and bear, but I also enjoy bird hunting in the fall.

      <h2>Fishing</h2>
      <p>
        Fishing is another outdoor hobby Im passionate about. Whether its casting a line in a quiet lake or fishing in the Rogue River, theres nothing quite like the calm and focus that comes with being on the water.

        <h2>Why I Love the Outdoors</h2>
        <p>
          Being outside whether its hunting, fishing, or hikingâ€”keeps me grounded. The fresh air, the quiet, and the feeling of self reliance all make outdoor hobbies more than just recreation theyre a way of life.
